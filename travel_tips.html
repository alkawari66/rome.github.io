                            <p><strong>Currency</strong>: The currency in Rome, as in the rest of Italy, is the Euro (â‚¬).
                                Credit cards are widely accepted, but it's always a good idea to carry some cash, especially
                                for smaller businesses and market stalls. There are plenty of ATMs (called Bancomats) around
                                the city where you can withdraw cash.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Health</strong>: Pharmacies, or "Farmacia", are widely available in Rome and most
                                pharmacists speak a bit of English. If you have a medical emergency, dial 112 to reach the
                                emergency services. It's also advisable to have travel insurance that covers health.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Taxis</strong>: Taxis can be expensive, and rates increase at night and outside city
                                limits. Always ensure the meter is running when you start your journey to avoid being
                                overcharged. Alternatively, consider using public transport or ride-sharing apps like Uber,
                                which are often cheaper.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Eating</strong>: Romans usually eat late with lunch starting around 1 pm and dinner
                                not until 8 pm or later. Many restaurants close in the afternoon, between lunch and dinner.
                                When dining out, keep in mind that it's common to pay a cover charge ("coperto") which is
                                added to the bill. Try local dishes like Carbonara, Roman-style pizza, and gelato.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Language</strong>: The official language is Italian. While many people in Rome speak
                                English, especially in tourist areas, it's appreciated if you learn a few basic Italian
                                phrases. A simple "Buongiorno" (Good morning), "Per favore" (Please) and "Grazie" (Thank
                                you) can go a long way.</p>
                        </li>
