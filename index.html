                    <p>Rome was called the "<strong>Eternal City</strong>" by the ancient Romans because they believed
                        that no matter what happened in the rest of the world, <strong>the city of Rome would always
                            remain standing</strong>. Exploring the city center by foot surrounded by <strong>glorious
                            monuments and colossal remains</strong> takes you back in time to the "glory that was Rome".

                            <q>The Eternal City truly lives up to its reputation. I had a fantastic time exploring Rome,
                                with its ancient ruins, captivating art, and exquisite cuisine. Walking through the
                                streets felt like stepping back in time, with the awe-inspiring Colosseum and the
                                enchanting Roman Forum. Not to mention the Vatican City, which was a spiritual journey
                                in itself. The local dishes, particularly the pasta and gelato, were incredible. Rome is
                                an astonishing blend of history, culture, and gastronomy that never fails to
                                impress!</q>

                            <q>Visiting Rome was an enriching experience that I will never forget. I was especially
                                taken with the warmth and hospitality of the locals. The city's vibrant history is
                                everywhere you look, from the magnificent Pantheon to the iconic Trevi Fountain. I
                                enjoyed the opportunity to marvel at the masterpieces in the Vatican Museums, especially
                                the stunning Sistine Chapel. Strolling through Rome's picturesque streets and piazzas,
                                savouring delightful pizzas and sipping on local wines was the cherry on top. Rome is
                                indeed a dream destination for any travel lover!</q>
